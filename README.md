# Gesture-Based-Game-Controller_Authentic_Geeks

Winter Hackathon NIT Goa - Nov 2023

Team Name : Authentic_geeks
Team Leader: Ayushi Kandpal (22CSE1004)
Team Member: Rakshitha K (22CSE1028)

Problem Statement: Gesture Based Game Controller


Theme: Python

Libraries Used: 
1) OpenCV,
2) MediaPipe,
3) TensorFlow,
4) PyAutoGUI


Features:

1 Gesture Recognition: The primary feature
of the controller is its ability to recognize
gestures like hand movements and finger
gestures to control the Tetris blocks.

2 Positional Tracking: Ensure accurate
tracking of the player's hand or body
position, allowing precise control over the
Tetris pieces' movement.


3 Rotations: Enable gesture-based rotations
for the Tetris pieces. For instance, 
specific gesture to rotate the piece 90
degrees clockwise
