Team Name : Authentic_geeks
Team Leader: Ayushi Kandpal (22CSE1004)
Team Member: Rakshitha K (22CSE1028)

Problem Statement: Gesture Based Game Controller


Theme: Python

Libraries Used: 
1 OpenCV
2 MediaPipe
3 TensorFlow
4 PyAutoGUI


Features:

1 Gesture Recognition: The primary feature
of the controller is its ability to recognize
gestures like hand movements and finger
gestures to control the Tetris blocks.

2 Positional Tracking: Ensure accurate
